== Basics

=== Export - Import

An STF asset is represented by a Blender Collection. By default, that is the Scene Collection.

If you wish to use another one, select it and check `Use as STF Prefab`.
If you click the `Set as STF export root` button, it will be automatically selected on export.

Anything parented to the Collection will be exported.

When an STF file gets imported, it will become its own Collection.

=== Resources
Everything that can be exported in STF will get its own unique ID. If it is not set on before export, STF will automatically assign one. If STF encounters a duplicate ID, it will reassing it.
By default the Blender name of a resource will be used, it can be optionally overridden.

=== Component Resources
Resource have Components. These are 'sub-resources' which add additional information/data to their parent resource. Some, like mesh-seams are natively supported by Blender, however most arent.
Components can be added/edited in the `Components` section of each resources panel.
